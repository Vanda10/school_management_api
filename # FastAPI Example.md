 # FastAPI Example

This is a simple FastAPI application that demonstrates how to create a REST API with Python.

## Prerequisites

To run this application, you will need the following:

* Python 3.6 or later
* FastAPI
* Uvicorn

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

## Running the Application

To run the application, open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located. Then, run the following command:

```
uvicorn main:app
```

This will start the FastAPI application on port 8000.

## Routes

The application defines two routes:

* `/`: This route returns a simple JSON response with the message "Hello, World!".
* `/items/{item_id}`: This route returns a JSON response with the item ID and an optional query parameter `q`.

## Code Explanation

### `main.py`

The `main.py` file contains the following code:

```python
from typing import Union
import uvicorn
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}


@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(item_id: int, q: Union[str, None] = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app=app)
```

Let's break down the code step by step:

1. We start by importing the necessary modules.
2. We create a FastAPI application instance.
3. We define a route for the root URL (`/`). This route returns a simple JSON response with the message "Hello, World!".
4. We define a route for the `/items/{item_id}` URL. This route returns a JSON response with the item ID and an optional query parameter `q`.
5. Finally, we start the FastAPI application using the `uvicorn.run()` function.

## Testing the Application

To test the application, open a web browser and navigate to the following URL:

```
http://localhost:8000/
```
